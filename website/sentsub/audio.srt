00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,000
<font color="#000000">You know we should all do.
</font>

1
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:08,660
<font color="#000000">Go see a musical.
</font>

2
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,540
<font color="#000000">Sure.
</font>

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,920
<font color="#FFCCCC">And you know which one we should see?
</font>

4
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,260
<font color="#000000">The 1996 Tony Award winner.
</font>

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,900
<font color="#FFCCCC">Do you happen to know the name of that one?
</font>

6
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:25,980
<font color="#0000ff">I don't know, um, Greece.
</font>

7
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,660
<font color="#FFCCCC">No.
</font>

8
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:32,120
<font color="#FFCCCC">Rent?
</font>

9
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:34,060
<font color="#000000">Yes,
</font>

10
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:34,740
<font color="#FFCCCC">rent.
</font>

11
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,620
<font color="#000000">Okay, so when do you want to go?
</font>

12
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:38,260
<font color="#FFCCCC">What?
</font>

13
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,120
<font color="#FFCCCC">Oh, I'm sorry I can't, I'm busy.
</font>

14
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,100
<font color="#000000">Hey,
</font>

15
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:48,840
<font color="#FFCCCC">man, it is so hard to shop for girls.
</font>

16
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,220
<font color="#000000">Yes, it is.
</font>

17
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,720
<font color="#0000ff">At office max.
</font>

18
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:56,620
<font color="#FFCCCC">What did you get her?
</font>

19
00:00:58,820 --> 00:00:59,440
<font color="#FFCCCC">A pen.
</font>

20
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:02,220
<font color="#000000">It's two gifts in one.
</font>

21
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:02,840
<font color="#FFCCCC">It's a pen.
</font>

22
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:04,340
<font color="#FFCCCC">That's also a clock.
</font>

23
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:08,100
<font color="#FFCCCC">You can't give her that.
</font>

24
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,620
<font color="#FFCCCC">Why not? Because she's not 11.
</font>

25
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,400
<font color="#FFCCCC">And it's not the seventh night of Hanukkah.
</font>

26
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,480
<font color="#FFCCCC">What?
</font>

27
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,960
<font color="#FFCCCC">What he means by that is,
</font>

28
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,020
<font color="#000000">while this is a very nice gift,
</font>

29
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:24,480
<font color="#FFCCCC">maybe it's just not something a boyfriend gives?
</font>

30
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,720
<font color="#000000">Sure it is.
</font>

31
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,760
<font color="#FFCCCC">She needs a pen for work.
</font>

32
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:28,860
<font color="#000000">She's writing.
</font>

33
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:29,760
<font color="#FFCCCC">She turns it over.
</font>

34
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,580
<font color="#FFCCCC">Whoa! It's time for my date with Joey.
</font>

35
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,100
<font color="#000000">All right, look,
</font>

36
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:38,020
<font color="#FFCCCC">look, what did you get for Angela Dumback?
</font>

37
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,360
<font color="#FFCCCC">What did you get for her? She didn't have a birthday while we were going out.
</font>

38
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:42,520
<font color="#FFCCCC">For three years.
</font>

39
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,440
<font color="#FFCCCC">Look,
</font>

40
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:47,880
<font color="#FFCCCC">it's too late.
</font>

41
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:48,860
<font color="#000000">And I got an audition.
</font>

42
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,420
<font color="#00ff00">I can't shop anymore.
</font>

43
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:55,960
<font color="#000000">I will go out and I will try to find something for her, okay?
</font>

44
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:57,620
<font color="#000000">Thanks, man.
</font>

45
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:58,680
<font color="#000000">And oh,
</font>

46
00:01:59,180 --> 00:01:59,780
<font color="#FFCCCC">while you're at it,
</font>

47
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,540
<font color="#000000">could you get her a card?
</font>

48
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:04,300
<font color="#000000">Would you like me to write her a little poem as well?
</font>

49
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:08,040
<font color="#FFCCCC">Or just get a card that has a poem already in it?
</font>

50
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:08,440
<font color="#000000">Yep.</font>
