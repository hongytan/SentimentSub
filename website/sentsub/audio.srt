00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,880
Ice cream!

1
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:03,420
On very hot days,

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:05,240
Miss Rabbit sells ice cream.

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:06,460
Mummy, Daddy!

4
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,040
Can George and I have an ice cream, please?

5
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:09,840
Oh, well,

6
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:12,400
I suppose it isn't especially hot day.

7
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,660
Yay! Please, can I have one as well?

8
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,600
Everyone likes ice cream.

9
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:20,060
Hello, Mummy Pig, Pepper and George.

10
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:21,320
Hello, Miss Rabbit.

11
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:23,520
What ice creams would you like?

12
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,940
Can I have a cone, please, Miss Rabbit?

13
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:27,860
Of course you may, Pepper.

14
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:28,840
Thank you.

15
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,480
The same for me and one for Daddy Pig, please.

16
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,060
And what would young Mr.

17
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,060
George like?

18
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,540
Dinosaur! A dinosaur?

19
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:39,800
Silly

20
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:40,400
George.

21
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,160
He always says dinosaur for everything.

22
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:45,040
Well,

23
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,420
it just so happens that I do have a dinosaur

24
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:49,700
shape to ice lonely.

25
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,280
Dinosaur.

26
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:54,560
George,

27
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,980
you should eat your ice lolly before it melts.

28
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,840
Dinosaur.

29
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:00,300
George loves his dinosaur

30
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,800
ice lolly so much he doesn't want to eat it.

31
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,260
Thank you, Miss Rabbit.

32
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:05,580
Enjoy the weather.

33
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:10,400
George, I really think you should eat your

34
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,260
ice lolly before it melts and falls on the ground.

35
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,960
Oh dear,

36
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,460
George's dinosaur ice lolly has melted

37
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:19,640
and fallen on the ground.

38
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,180
Never mind, George.

39
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,280
You can share Daddy's ice cream.

40
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:24,860
I'm sure he won't mind.

41
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:30,080
It is so warm,

42
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,700
Daddy Pig has fallen asleep.

43
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,620
Daddy Pig does look hot.

44
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,520
Let's do water on Daddy to call him down.

45
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,040
Good idea, Pepper.

46
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:41,500
What happened?

47
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,680
You were all red and hot, Daddy Pig.

48
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,640
So we took water on you.

49
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,140
Oh,

50
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,200
I see.

51
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,480
Thank you, Pepper.
