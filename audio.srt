00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:02,480
Here's going to happen.

1
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,540
I am going to have to fix you.

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:08,700
Manage you to on a more personal scale,

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,840
a more micro form of management.

4
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:12,820
Jim, what is that called?

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:13,680
Micro-Jimmin?

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:14,200
Boom.

7
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:14,640
Yes.

8
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:16,640
Now Jim is going to be the client.

9
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:19,120
Dwight, you're going to have to sell to him

10
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:22,380
without being aggressive, hostile or difficult.

11
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:23,560
Let's go.

12
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:24,380
All right, fine.

13
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:26,580
Ring,

14
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:27,260
ring.

15
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:28,760
Hello.

16
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,600
Hello, this is Dwight Shrut from the Dundermiffland Paper Company.

17
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,320
Well, that's great because I need paper.

18
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,400
Excellent that you are in luck because we are having a limited time offer only on everything.

19
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:39,940
Wow, this is my lucky day.

20
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,800
What is your name, sir?

21
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,180
I am Bill Butlerker.

22
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:45,880
Really, that's your real name?

23
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,820
How dare you?

24
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,240
My family built this country,

25
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:50,760
by the way.

26
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:51,740
Thank you, respectful, Dwight.

27
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:52,060
Please.

28
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:52,760
Yes, Michael.

29
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,540
Did you hold on one second?

30
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,180
That's my other one.

31
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:54,660
What?

32
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:55,800
No, but I...

33
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:56,020
Hello?

34
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:57,320
Yeah.

35
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,780
I'm just not a phone with this stupid salesman.

36
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:01,640
He's so dumb.

37
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,240
Probably just going to keep him on the line forever, not by anything.

38
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,260
Okay.

39
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:08,840
It's up to you to change the mind.

40
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:09,920
Sorry.

41
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:11,760
That was a family emergency.

42
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,040
Oh no, what's wrong?

43
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:13,720
You know what?

44
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,400
That's private.

45
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,460
Boundary Dwight, come on.

46
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,500
I'm sorry, Mr.

47
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:17,920
Butlerker.

48
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,580
As I was saying,

49
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,060
we are having a limited...

50
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:20,140
We're having a limited,

51
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,020
a little bit louder,

52
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:21,580
I'm heart-of-earing.

53
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,780
Sorry if he's an old man.

54
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:23,200
Okay.

55
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,200
As I was saying,

56
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:25,720
right now we are having a louder.

57
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:26,160
Okay,

58
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,780
our prices have never been lower.

59
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:28,780
So you have to talk loud.

60
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:29,840
Never been lower.

61
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:34,520
Louder, son! Butneker! Our prices have never been lower! Stop! Heat!

62
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,740
That is totally inappropriate.

63
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:39,920
You're never guilty of the client.

64
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:40,160
You're never guilty of the client.

65
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,480
Now you listen to me, sir.

66
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,260
Here we go.

67
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,460
The three words I would describe you as is aggressive,

68
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:46,500
hostile,

69
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:47,940
and definitely difficult.

70
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:48,500
Please Mr.

71
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:48,740
Butler.

72
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:49,720
I'm my rate right now.

73
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:50,240
Give me the phone.

74
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,220
Give me another chance.

75
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:51,840
Give me the phone.

76
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,000
Mr.

77
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:52,520
Butlerker.

78
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:53,020
Give me the phone.

79
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,360
I have to put you on with my phone.

80
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,220
I'll flush it hope so.

81
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,380
Who is this?

82
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,600
Hello, this is Michael Scott, regional manager.

83
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,140
Well, this is William M.

84
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:00,860
Butlerker.

85
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:01,600
Hello, Mr.

86
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:02,160
Butlerker.

87
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,060
How may we help you?

88
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,240
Michael, I like the sound of your voice.

89
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,160
You know what I'm gonna do?

90
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,860
I'm gonna buy one million dollars worth of paper products today.

91
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,820
Yeah! Yeah! Thanks, Tom.

92
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,480
Thank you very much, sir.

93
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,140
I don't think you'll regret it.

94
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:15,620
You know what I did?

95
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:16,320
You are the master.

96
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:17,240
There is one condition,

97
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:17,580
Michael.

98
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:17,900
Yes.

99
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,520
You have to fire the salesman that treated me so terribly.

100
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:21,300
Don't do it, Michael.

101
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,380
It's a million dollars, Alan. Thank you.
